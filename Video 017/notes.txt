Types of Selector

Element selector: they select entire elements(div, span, p) on which css properties will apply
        div{
            /* Element Selector */
            background-color: burlywood;
        }


Class selector: The value given to class attribute in an html tag can be used as a class selector in CSS

    <div class="gold">
        This is so gold
    </div>

then in style tag we do

    .gold{
        background-color: goldenrod;
    }
this .gold mean that which ever class has .gold it means class is gold

ID selector: The value given to id attribute in an html tag can be used as a id selector in CSS

    <div id="green">
        This is so green
    </div>

then in style tag we do

    #green{
        background-color: green;
    }

Child selector: A certain specified tag has a certain specified child tag then the chlid selector can specify
css properties of that Element. But it needs to be an immediate child

    <div> <p> This is a child of div </p> </div>

in the style tag we do:

    div > p{
        color: burlywood
    }

Decendent selector: This is very similar to child selector, but here instead of a child it applies to all decendents

    <div>
        <span>
            <p>
                This is a decendent selector
            </p>
        </span>
    </div>

in the style tag we do:
    div p{ /*decendent selector*/
        background-color: yellowgreen;
    }

Universal selector: it applies univesally to wherever it is imported

in style we do 

    *{
            margin:0;
            padding:0;
     }

Pseudo selector: They work for special state of an element

a:link{
            color: aquamarine;
            background-color: blue;
        }

        a:visited{
            background-color: violet;
        }

        a:hover{
            background-color: rgb(242, 10, 41);
        }

        div:active{
            background-color: black;
        }

here a stands for ancor tag

    p: first-child{
        background-color: black;
    }

here when p is the first child of its parent then this property will apply
