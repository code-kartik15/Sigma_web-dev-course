BOX model notes:

In css all elements are box, div container etc.

css model states content inside padding inside border inside margin

Browser adds margin and padding on its own.

To reset this do this in a universal selector

*{
    margin:0;
    padding:0;
}

we can add multiple classes to an element

for ex: <div class="box box1">

now we can add css properties for box1 and box seperately

in the browser console when you go to elements tab and click on any on element like div etc, see on the left side, 
where you can change certain properties temporarily under styles. If you go to computed then you can see that elements, width,
height border etc. 

Margin is outside the element so the background of the element is not retained. (background color will stay in content and 
padding not in margin)

Due to some DPI factor the size of border you see in computed tab will be different then the one mentioned in code 

To calculate actual width = width + left padding + right padding + left border + right border + left margin + right margin
actual height = height + top padding + bottom padding + top border + bottom border + top margin + bottom margin

if we write this property in a css selector -> box-sizing: border-box then this means if we put height:200px
then 200px = height + top padding + bottom padding + top border + bottom border

Margin collapse: if box 1 has margin as 25 px, and box 2 has margin of 35 px. then the margin between the space between them is 35, because of margin collapse.
It states if margin of two elements is overlapping then the bigger margin will be applied only once.
