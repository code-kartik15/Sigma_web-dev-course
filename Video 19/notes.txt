Fonts:

This is how to define fonts in web browser
        p{
            font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;
        }

There are multiple fonts present above as the rest are fallback fonts, they are useful in case the customer's web browser 
doesnt support the primary font.
font-style: oblique; // we can use font style to make text italic, oblique etc
to make font bold we use font weight
we can also use text-decoration: overline, underline etc;
https://codepen.io/web-dot-dev/pen/yLojraG => we can use this to check what all font families look like
https://fonts.google.com => visit this to use google fonts
there are 2 ways to include fonts from google fonts , through link or through import
put the @ import url in style and the copy css in usual way
2nd way is to and link tag to head and remove @import from style tag
we can add multiple fonts using the import or link tag at once
If you dont mention font size in code, then the browser autmoatically sets. To see the size value, inspect the 
element 
line height tag can be used to have a certain size difference between two lines of a paragraph 
letter spacing can be used to increase spaces between indivisual letters
text-transform can be use to perform action like uppercase, lowercase, capitalize


            text-transform: uppercase;
            text-decoration: underline;
            text-decoration-color: aqua;
            text-decoration-style: wavy;
            text-decoration-thickness: 7px;

text-indent to indent text some distance ahead from start


            text-overflow: ellipsis; 
            overflow: hidden; 

then the word would appear like lore... before moving to next line 
 

            text-overflow: clip;
            width: 45px;


then the word would appear like lore before moving to next line and the entire rest of the word would begin from there
word-break: break-all; this will now hide the word but break them even if there are cut in next line

        }
        
        .rbgwala{
            color: rgb(rgb(111, 33, 33))

        .rbgawala{
            color:rgba(rgba(152, 46, 46, 0.601))
